About the Department

Who We Are  
In cities across the country, people face high rates of gun violence, under-resourced schools, and social harms associated with the criminal justice system -- all of which disproportionately impact people of color. These inequalities have profound consequences on public safety and opportunity. As a society we have failed to address these challenges, in part, because of our lack of understanding of the most effective and cost-effective solutions that can have a real impact on people’s lives. We believe that rigorous research can help.
 
The University of Chicago Crime Lab and Education Lab partner with cities and communities to use data and rigorous research to design, test, and scale programs and policies that enhance public safety, improve educational outcomes, and advance justice. Our mission is to combine world-class data science and research, in partnership with government agencies, to substantially improve the effectiveness of the public sector and achieve impact at scale.
 
The Role
The University of Chicago Crime Lab and Education Lab are seeking a data scientist to work on our portfolio of projects applying machine learning to public policy. We’re seeking a smart, motivated, and detail-oriented person to work on all parts of our applied machine learning projects – all the way from cleaning and structuring raw data to developing predictive models and evaluating them in a randomized control trial. An ideal candidate will have experience extracting insights from data and communicating them to both technical and non-technical audiences.
The position offers the opportunity to work directly with leading researchers at the University of Chicago and policymakers on projects with immediate real-world impact. You will collaborate closely with PhD-level computer science and economics researchers, as well as top-notch research managers and organizational leadership. This position is particularly well-suited for candidates who may be interested in pursuing a PhD in the future or for data scientists who want to transition from industry to public policy research.
